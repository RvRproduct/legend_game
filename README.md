# Overview
This Application is Called Legend_Game
This is a platformer/shooter game, that was made using Python and the arcade library.
The goal of this game is to beat all the enemies on the screen to open the blockade to
get to the next level.

How to Play: use wasd or the arrow keys to move and click the left mouse button to shoot.

I have a handful of game project ideas I would like to work on in the future, but
I think I would use a different library to develop it.

# Development Environment

I used Python, Arcade, and Visual Studio to create this application.

I used Python and the arcade library, I split it up in separte files, so that
I could have cleaner and more understandable code.

# Future Work

* Getting Better at analyzing how long an idea might take within a deadline.
* Getting better at understanding the library given to me, if I am using one, so I can use it to its maximum capacity.
* Get better at Python, so I can feel as though I can create anything with it.
